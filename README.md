Code from https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper/09-ZombieRunner-Original built for Daydream VR. Experiments are currently ongoing to add Daydream controller support for movement. However if you use a Worldsense headset (like Lenovo Mirage) you should be able to move using 6dof tracking even with no controller.
